# About
Various web related modules.  There is currently just a modified version of the existing urllib module in 2142 along with its dependencies.  These have been modified the minimum amount to be usable to make simple `GET` requests using `urlopen`.  I have not tested, and do not support, any other usage at this time.  More support will be added as needed.
