# About
It is possible to load an unrestricted python interpreter into 2142.  The instructions for doing so are [here](./guides/unrestricted_python.md).  With an unrestricted python interpreter, the full python standard library can be used as is.  This repository contains guides for giving python more control of the game engine and will eventually house a library for doing so in a less complex fashion.
